# MuscleECM_Project
This repository contains simulations and visualizations for modeling muscle stem cellâ€“ECM fiber interactions in 3D, using PyQtGraph and OpenGL.

## Folder Overview:

### New Visualizations (OpenGL):
Contains the latest integrin-fiber interaction visualizations rendered in 3D using PyQtGraph. These include interactive and dynamic simulations of integrin activation, fiber deformation, and spatial organization.

### Old Visualizations (Matplotlib):
Archives previous 2D and static 3D visualizations created using matplotlib. These were used in earlier development stages for prototyping before switching to OpenGL.

### Videos_of_Visualizations:
Holds .mp4 recordings of key simulation outputs, capturing the behavior of integrins and ECM fibers over time. These are useful for presentation and analysis.
